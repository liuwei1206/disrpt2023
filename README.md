For running Task 1 and Task 2, activate your Conda environment and make sure your environment matches the requirements.txt. Then, in a folder called **data**, put the all corpora data in the folder called **dataset**. For example, the data path for the corpus eng.pdtb.pdtb will be **data/dataset/eng.pdtb.pdtb**. After that, you can use the command **sh run_task12.sh** in your terminal to run the code for Task 1 and Task 2.
